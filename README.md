# breast-cancer
In this project, we explored a breast cancer dataset to understand its structure and clean it up for further analysis. Hereâ€™s what we did:

* We loaded the dataset, looked at the first few rows, and identified key columns like tumor features (e.g., radius_mean, texture_mean) and the target (diagnosis, indicating benign or malignant).

* We removed unnecessary columns (id and one empty column) and confirmed there were no missing values.

* We checked basic stats (mean, min, max) for each feature to understand their ranges.

Visualization: We made a simple plot to show that the dataset has more benign tumors than malignant ones.

Result:
We now have a clean dataset, ready for further analysis. We also observed that most cases in the dataset are benign, which is important for future modeling.
